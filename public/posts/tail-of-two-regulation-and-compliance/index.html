My app told me to be fast. Both were right.\nI learned the ugly lesson that regulation isn’t a checkbox you slap on before launch - it’s the scaffolding you build around a product so it doesn’t collapse under scale, lawyers, or reality. Below is one continuous train of thought from a college engineer who shipped features, survived a sweaty audit-ish week, and came out with practical habits you can adopt on day one.\nWhat HIPAA and SOC 2 are (short, practical) HIPAA - a U.S. law protecting health data (PHI). If your app handles health-related info tied to people, HIPAA matters. It mandates administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Think training, access controls, and secure storage. SOC 2 - an audit framework from AICPA. Not a law, but a vendor trust report. It proves you have controls for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. Enterprises love it because it reduces their vendor risk. One is legal obligation (HIPAA); the other is a commercial trust badge (SOC 2). Both cost more energy to ignore than to implement.\nThe first day: concrete, non-sucky defaults Treat the first deploy like you’re already talking to an enterprise CISO. It changes how you design.\nDay-one checklist (do this before your second commit):\nMap your data flows. What we collect, why, where it moves, and where it rests. Draw it. Pretend the auditor is watching. RBAC by default. No admin:true toggles for interns. Roles, not exceptions. Secrets manager. Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or equivalent. No secrets in config.yml. No exceptions. TLS everywhere. TLS in transit, encryption at rest where available. Use managed services for keys if you can. Structured logging + redaction. Don’t log raw PHI, PANs, SSNs, or tokens. Enforce schema with a linter. Retention policy. Put TTLs on logs and backups. If you don’t need 2 years of debug traces, don’t keep them. Incident one-pager. A one-page runbook: who calls legal, who flips the kill switch, and how to notify customers. Example redaction snippet:\n// simple log sanitizer (pseudo) function sanitize(obj) { return { ...obj, ssn: mask(obj.ssn), // show only last 4 card: hashLast4(obj.card), token: '[REDACTED]' } } Small things like this save you weeks later.\nWhy retrofitting hurts (my sad tale) We shipped a helpful logging hook that printed error payloads to make debugging instant. It felt like magic. It was also writing PHI and tokens in plaintext to our logs.\nWhen a security review found it:\nWe spent three weeks rewriting hundreds of logging call sites. We had to reprocess logs and scrub PII from backups - painful, slow, and error-prone. Two deals paused while legal did “due diligence.” Hiring momentum slowed because founders were on calls with lawyers. Engineers lost a little faith in “move fast” as a motto; we learned that speed without guardrails breaks trust. The technical cost was measurable. The human cost - reputation, stress, morale - was worse.\nObfuscation \u0026 dataset hygiene - not glamour, but necessary If you need realistic data without real people, use tokenization, salted hashing, aggregation, or differential privacy depending on the use case.\nTokenization/pseudonymization - replace IDs with tokens so you can link records without revealing identity. Salted hashes - deterministic but safer; rotate salts carefully. Aggregation/binning - share ranges, not exact values. Differential privacy - math noise; powerful but easy to misuse. Rule of thumb: obfuscation is only effective if your keys/salts are managed properly. Treat tokens as secrets.\nIncident response: practice like a drill team Real incidents are messy. Practice makes the real thing survivable.\nKeep runbooks one page. Name people, steps, and communication templates. Run tabletop exercises quarterly. Simulate: “DB contains unredacted PHI.” Talk it out. Automate evidence collection (access logs, deploy IDs) so audits don’t require heroic digging. Postmortems: no blame, just facts → hypothesis → fix → follow-up. Communication is a control. Tell customers early, clearly, and with a plan.\nContracts, vendors, and the boring-but-essential parts Engineers often tune out contract language until it’s urgent. Don’t.\nBAAs are mandatory for HIPAA-covered PHI. If a vendor won’t sign a BAA, don’t pass PHI through them. For SOC 2-bound customers, have your vendor risk assessments and evidence ready. Treat contractual promises as product requirements - if a customer asks for a SOC 2 report, that’s now part of the product roadmap. Contracts set expectations. Meet them.\nA practical 30/90/180 cadence to actually ship trust Day 1-30: map data, RBAC, secrets manager, TLS, structured logs, one-page incident runbook. Day 31-90: automated redaction pipeline, retention policies, basic access review cadence, vendor BAAs. Run your first tabletop. Day 91-180: continuous vulnerability scanning, backups verification, automated evidence collection for audits. Start preparing for SOC 2 Type I if that’s your goal. SOC 2 Type I = snapshot of controls. Type II = controls operating over time. Plan months, not days.\nClosing: the attitude (not the checklist) The best practice I learned: treat constraints as design inputs. When you design to minimize data collection, you also reduce blast radius. When you bake RBAC into your models, you reduce accidental misuse. Automation turns compliance from a chore into a feature.\nCompliance is boring until it saves your product, your users, or your reputation. Build the boring stuff early. Ship the cool stuff fast, but protected. If your future self is grateful, you probably did it right.\n","wordCount":"894","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://timavilov.com/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2024-08-25T07:52:54-07:00","dateModified":"2024-08-25T07:52:54-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://timavilov.com/posts/tail-of-two-regulation-and-compliance/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"T|A","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://timavilov.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://timavilov.com/ accesskey=h title="T|A (Alt + H)">T|A</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
